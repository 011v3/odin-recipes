    <ul>
        <li>at about 10 years of age, you:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>ask strangers on the neopets forums to code your neohomepage for you</li>
            <li>a kind stranger will actually do this for you</li>
            <li>you will spend many months randomly changing things in the code until you gain a very rudimentary understanding of what that does</li>
        </ul>
        <li>now that you can change the color of a link you consider yourself highly skilled</li>
        <li>promptly forget everything after the neopets phase ends</li>
        <li>eventually you create a tumblr blog and try to do the same thing you did on neopets</li>
        <li>it does not work</li>
        <li>remain satisfied with editing redux</li>
        <li>promptly forget everything once you switch to mobile blogging</li>
        <li>fast forward many years: you purchase a personal url</li>
        <li>you link that to a neocities site</li>
        <li>you realize you are getting nowhere with w3schools</li>
        <li>friend recommends odin project!</li>
        <li><strong>LOOK AT ME NOW!!!!</strong></li>
